# Book Structure

## Proposed Outline (v0.2) — Lessons-Learned Structure

**Theme:** This isn't a linear success story. It's a stumble-through guide.

---

### Part I: The Stumble
**The messy truth of not knowing what you're doing**

1. **You Don't Need Permission** — The myth of credentials and gatekeepers
2. **Start Before You're Ready** — The art of the awkward first step
3. **The Imposter is Right** — You actually don't know what you're doing (and that's fine)

### Part II: The Method
**How to teach yourself when no one taught you how**

4. **Steal from Giants** — The philosophy of productive copying
5. **Clone First, Understand Later** — Learning by building what already exists
6. **The Projects Are the Curriculum** — You don't need a syllabus, you need a problem

### Part III: The Reality
**What actually happens when you get the job**

7. **The Job Hunt is a Numbers Game** — Rejection, persistence, and proving it
8. **First Year: Fake It Till You Make It** — What they don't teach in bootcamps
9. **The Gap is Real** — What CS grads know and how to catch up without the degree

### Part IV: The Lessons
**What stumbling taught me**

10. **Credentials Don't Write Code** — Skills > paper, always
11. **Find Your People** — Mentorship, community, and not doing it alone
12. **Play the Long Game** — This isn't a sprint, it's a career

### Part V: For the Next Stumbler
**How to do what I did (without my mistakes)**

13. **The Stumble-Through Guide** — Step-by-step for the self-taught path
14. **The Toolkit** — Actual resources that worked
15. **It's Never Too Late** — Final thoughts for the late starters

## Structure Decisions ✅

- [x] **Thematic, not chronological** — Grouped by lessons learned
- [x] **Mix memoir + how-to** — Each chapter: story + actionable takeaway
- [ ] Include code examples/tutorials? *[Pending]*
- [ ] Interview other non-traditional engineers? *[Pending]*

---

## Key Stories to Include

- [ ] The first giant we stole from *(which one? what feature?)*
- [ ] A cloning project that went wrong — and what it taught me
- [ ] The breaking point — why I started coding
- [ ] The first job interview *(the one I bombed vs. the one I got)*
- [ ] A time when not having a CS degree hurt
- [ ] A time when the non-traditional path was an advantage
- [ ] The project where I finally felt like I knew what I was doing
