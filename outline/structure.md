# Book Structure — DRAFT / WORK IN PROGRESS

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is a placeholder. The real structure will emerge from the stories we collect.

**Current Thinking:** Lessons-learned approach (not chronological). But we need DATA first.

## Possible Themes (Guesses Until We Have Stories)

### The Stumble
- Permission / gatekeepers
- Starting before ready
- Imposter syndrome

### The Method
- Stealing/cloning as learning
- Projects over curriculum
- Learning by building

### The Reality
- Job hunting
- First year on the job
- The CS degree gap

### The Lessons
- Skills vs. credentials
- Community/mentorship
- Long-term thinking

## Process

1. **Collect stories** → `stories/raw-stories.md` ← WE ARE HERE
2. **Review & tag** → Find patterns in the raw material
3. **Cluster** → Group stories by emergent themes
4. **Structure** → Build chapters around themes that actually appeared
5. **Write** → Draft with full knowledge of the arc
