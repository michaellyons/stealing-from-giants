## Quick Brainstorm Prompts

Don't answer all of these. Just pick whatever sparks a memory:

- [ ] The moment you decided to learn coding — what triggered it?
- [ ] The first "How should this work?" where you cloned something
- [ ] A time you felt completely lost but kept going
- [ ] A project that almost broke you
- [ ] A project that made you feel like "okay, I can do this"
- [ ] The worst coding mistake you made
- [ ] The first time someone paid you to code
- [ ] A time not having a CS degree bit you
- [ ] A time not having a CS degree helped you
- [ ] The interview that went wrong
- [ ] The interview that went right
- [ ] A piece of advice that actually stuck
- [ ] A moment you realized you were thinking like an engineer
- [ ] Something you built that you're proud of
- [ ] Something you built that you're embarrassed by now
