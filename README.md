## The Premise

The title comes from the early days of building things when you don't know what you're doing. When faced with any decision ("How should this work?"), the strategy was simple: pick a relevant software giant who already had the feature, and clone it.

**This isn't a linear success story. It's a stumble-through guide.**

I didn't follow a curriculum. I stumbled through projects, cloned products I admired, and learned by building things that already existed. This book organizes those stumbles into lessons—so the next person can stumble a little less.

This book is for:
- Career switchers
- Self-taught developers
- People questioning if they need a CS degree
- Anyone who feels "behind" the traditional path
- People who learn by doing, not by reading textbooks
